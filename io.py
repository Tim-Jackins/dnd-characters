    vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within
    60 feet of you as if it were bright 1ight, and in darkness as if
    it were dim light. You can’t dis- cern color in darkness, only
    shades of gray.
    
    **Hellish Resistance** You have resistance to fire damage.
    
    **Infernal Legacey** You know the thaumatuqJy cantrip.  Once you
    reach 3rd level, you can cast the hellish rebuke spell once per
    day as a 2nd-levei spell. Once you reach 5th level, you can also
    cast the darkness spell once per day.  Charisma is your
    spellcasting ability for these spells.
   
    **Dark One’s Blessing (The Fiend)** When you reduce a hostile
    creature to O hit-points, you gain temporary hit points equal to
    your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).""")
