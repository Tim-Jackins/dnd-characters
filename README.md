This repository contains character sheets in two formats: LaTeX and
dungeonsheets.

# LaTeX Character Sheets

Shamelessly stolen from
[this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2zh01c/i_made_my_bard_a_customized_character_sheet_using/)
by /u/hurrayforzac on reddit. Looking to turn this into a class file

# DungeonSheets Character Sheets

Character sheets can be built from ``.py`` files using the
[dungeonsheets](https://github.com/canismarko/dungeon-sheets)
tool. Install dungeonsheets from the python package index, and run
``makesheets`` to build the PDF character sheet.

    $ pip install dungeonsheets
    $ cd DnD-character-sheets
    $ makesheets
